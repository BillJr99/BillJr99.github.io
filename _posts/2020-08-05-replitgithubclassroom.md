In this article, we'll set up a [GitHub classroom](https://classroom.github.com) with [Repl.it](https://repl.it).  Earlier, I have written articles on [using Git with GitHub](/posts/2020/02/github/) and [using GitHub Classroom](/posts/2020/02/githubclassroom/).  Here, I have produced a short video walking through their setup and use with the popular pair-programming IDE Repl.It.
