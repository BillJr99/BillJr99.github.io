In this article, we will explore tools that enable students to leverage technology in informal contexts that facilitate problem solving in preparation for diverse workforce pathways.  Technical solutions and automation aren't just for Computer Science majors, and there exists a variety of platforms that support exploration and learning as well as productive applications of computing.  Our goal is to democratize computing skillsets across all disciplines, and to give students the tools they need to bring computing and technology to their favorite subjects.  This has the potential to enhance teaching and learning broadly, and to facilitate participation in computing with inexpensive (or free!) no-code or ubiquitous-code platforms.

We will sample some tools that have been developed and used in Southeastern Pennsylvania to enable students to explore computing concepts and discover solutions to authentic problems, with an aim toward building their confidence in creatively applying technology to workforce-relevant application domains.  We will connect these tools to potential careers and career pathways, and conclude with a survey of industry-grade no-code (or ubiquitous-code) platforms for further exploration.

### Bridging the Classroom and the Workforce through Design Thinking

Some problems are hard to approach because we lack the complete worldview required to solve them entirely.  These are problems that are larger than any one of us, and require collaborative and often multidisciplinary teams.  There is no "perfect" textbook solution, and so an iterative cycle of planning, trial, evaluation, and feedback is needed.  These authentic problems provide opportunities to develop and apply design thinking skills.

Design Thinking seeks to understand the problem domain, which requires discussion with a variety of stakeholders \[[^6], [^7]\].  We're not likely to know all the right stakeholder groups until we "live and learn," and so this is an iterative and perhaps never-ending process.  One way to approach this is to experiment and prototype with potential solutions, and then "shop them" to your stakeholder groups for feedback.  Learning a new concept, whether it is a lesson on the Federalist Papers, the Pythagorean Theorem, or computer programming, can be considered an opportunity to learn and explore in-context through the Design Thinking process.  No-code platforms provide a mechanism to express those designs in an automated and collaborative environment.  In essence, we are applying inquiry and discovery learning through the use of technology platforms that are accessible to students across any discipline (in other words, not just the computer class). By viewing problems through the lense of the stakeholder, we bring empathy into the problem space, incorporate a "backwards design" by approaching problems from an outcomes perspective, and facilitate creative innovation in the classroom setting through role playing activities.

This approach enables collaboration across different classroom environments - not just between the STEM students and the context disciplines, but between entire environments.  For example, a rural school district familiar with regional challenges (for example, an agricultural or healthcare need) could engage with suburban and urban school districts with their own regional challenges (for example, traffic or environmental needs) to exchange broader perspectives and diversity of thought.  Often, the technology and platforms required to approach these challenges is similar across these problem spaces, and exchanging common ideas creates new pathways to collaboration as well as a diversification of perspectives.

## Platforms and Activities

### Lost-and-Found with the BBC Microbit 

If you've ever lost your backpack, glasses, or other items, you might be aware of [tools](https://www.thetileapp.com/) designed to help find those items by playing a sound and letting you see how close you are to the missing item.  By listening to the sound, you can track down where the missing item is.  As you get closer to the source, the sound becomes louder.  Sometimes, devices like these emit a radio signal - not an audible sound, but an invisible wave of light, that computers can sense with a radio antenna.  As you get closer to the source of the signal, the intensity of the signal increases, just like the sound did.  Using the [BBC Microbit](https://microbit.org/) no-code platform, we will develop a system to communicate a radio signal between two devices to play a game of "hide and seek" where the goal is to locate the source of the invisible signal \[[^4]\].

First, students should plan a solution together: what steps are required to play a game of [Marco Polo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Polo_(game))?  Without requiring a technical background, some insights can emerge: every so often, the "source" generates a signal that the players can hear (but can't see); this sound has a direction and intensity that helps the players move closer to the source.  As this repeats, if the sound becomes louder, we can infer that we are getting closer.  

Let's make a flow-chart of this idea and lay out the building blocks in the software environment \[[^4]\].
