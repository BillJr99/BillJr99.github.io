This software suite contains scripts to collect and store IoT sensor data, such as RFID tag information using an Impinj Speedway RFID reader.  It is modular and generalizable to a variety of sensor systems and processing needs.  

Information about the architecture of this system can be found in my [Ph.D. Dissertation](/publication/dissertation) and on [this paper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3055002) detailing the use of the framework on RFID-based sensor systems.

The packages for data collection and data processing, respectively, are hosted on GitHub at the following locations (please feel free to contact me for access if you are unable to view these pages):
