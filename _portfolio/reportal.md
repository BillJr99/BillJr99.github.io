[REportal](https://reportal.cs.drexel.edu) is a central repository for reverse engineering tools.	REportal contains a compresensive set of reverse engineering tools to profile and data mine source code and software systems.

Information about the development of the portal can be found in my [Masters Thesis](/publication/msthesis) and in [this paper](/publication/icpc2008) describing the architecture.
