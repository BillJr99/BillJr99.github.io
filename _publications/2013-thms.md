The recent growth of agent-based software systems was achieved without the development of a reference architecture. From a software engineering standpoint, a reference architecture is necessary to compare, evaluate, and integrate past, current, and future agent-based software systems. The agent systems reference architecture (ASRA) advances the agent-based system development process by providing a set of key interaction patterns for functional areas that exist between the layers and protocols of agent-based systems. Furthermore, the ASRA identifies the points for interoperability between agent-based systems and increases the level of discussion when referring to agent-based systems. This paper presents methodology, grounded in software forensics, to develop the ASRA and provides an overview of the resulting architectural representation. The methodology uses an approach based on software engineering techniques adapted to study agent frameworks-the libraries and tools for building agent systems. The resulting ASRA can serve as an abstract representation of the components necessary for facilitating comparison, integration, and interoperation of software systems composed of agents.
