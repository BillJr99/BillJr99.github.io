Bill holds the Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Drexel University since 2018, the M.Sc. in Science of Instruction at the Drexel School of Education since 2008, the M.Sc. in Computer Science since 2008, and the B.Sc. in Computer Science since 2005. His research interests include machine learning of passive RF wearable systems for biomedical classification, service-oriented architectures, and program comprehension through software engineering. As the founder and principal investigator of the Human-Machine Intelligent Systems (HMIS) Lab, Bill's research blends artificial intelligence and machine learning for human good. Bill is enthusiastically active in computer science education and engineering education outreach: he holds a teaching certification in Pennsylvania for Grades 7-12 Mathematics and Grades 7-12 Computer Science, has taught, volunteered, developed experiential curriculum connected to STEM research projects, and served as mentor and judge at hackathon events with students in grades 5 through 12. He has served on school board and county STEM, educational technology, and grant-writing committees, as well as in an educational consulting role with County Intermediate Units and State Departments of Education.  He is a member of the [Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA)](https://csteachers.org), with collaborators at the [CSTA>>Philly](https://philly.csteachers.org/) chapter and board service (since 2022) as Vice President of the the [Longwood](https://longwoodpa.csteachers.org/) chapter, a co-lead of the Expanding Computing Educational Pathways (ECEP) Alliance for Pennsylvania, a member of the board of the Innovative Technology Action Group (ITAG) of Chester County, PA, and a member of the board of managers for the Jim Fisher Memorial Digital Network Association since 2024.

Bill was appointed as Teaching Professor (2008-2019) and Associate Department Head for Undergraduate Affairs (2014-15 through 2019) of Computer Science in the College of Computing and Informatics at Drexel University, teaching the systems track and the new architecture track courses for the Department of Computer Science, including Operating Systems, Concurrent Programming, and Systems Architecture. Here, he blended his research and experiential education interests by fusing undergraduate as well as graduate education with classroom and extracurricular research initiatives. In these roles, he was a recipient of the 2014 College of Computing and Informatics Award for Teaching Excellence and the 2019 College of Computing and Informatics Award for Faculty Leadership. 

Bill [joined the faculty](https://www.ursinus.edu/live/profiles/5313-william-mongan) of the [Math and Computer Science Department](https://www.ursinus.edu/academics/mathematics-and-computer-science/) at [Ursinus College](https://www.ursinus.edu) as an Assistant Professor (visiting) in Fall, 2020, was elevated to Associate Professor in Fall, 2022, and received tenure in Summer, 2025.  At Ursinus, he is the Founder and Principal Investigator of the [Human-Machine Intelligent Systems Lab](http://www.hmislab.org), and the host of the [Digital Signature Podcast](https://www.digitalsignature.fm).

He is a Senior Member of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).

Aviation
======
I am an instrument rated private pilot, having trained at Cross Keys Airport (17N) in Williamstown, NJ and at Flying W Airport (N14) in Medford, NJ. I have flown a Cessna 152 (N94294), some Cessna 172â€™s (N172MG, N64608, N739UG, N226CA, N54812, N805FW, N10DJ, N329SP, and N738YT), a Piper Arrow PA-28 (N2954R), a twin Piper Seneca PA-38 (N1380T), and a Cirrus SR20 (N391TD).  I am also a Part 107 drone operator.

Amateur Radio
======
I am an Amateur Extra radio operator, licensed since 2017, with callsign {{ site.author.fcccallsign }}.  I am active with the [Montgomery County, PA ARES/RACES group (MCAR)](https://aa3e.org/), and in particular with the [AREDN mesh networking group](https://www.arednmesh.org/).  We are working to build out a peer-to-peer, self-healing mesh network that runs the TCP/IP stack over-the-air for emergency communications purposes.  I serve on the board of managers of the [Jim Fisher (AJ3DI/SK) Memorial Digital Network Association (JFMDNA)](https://www.jfmdna.org/), which aims to engage digital natives in amateur radio and mesh networking through this authentic and tech-centric application.  I enjoy working on mesh projects, including deploying digital networks over DMR through the mesh, expanding telephone access to the mesh through PBX, and analog-to-digital cross modes using AllStarLink.  I include various howto guides and notes I've taken while learning about various projects via the blog posts on this site.

You can find me on the airwaves through various ways:

* EchoLink: W1CLK (929783)
* AllStarLink: 62933
* MCAR Mesh W3EX-PBX: Extension 215-3521
* MCAR Mesh W1CLK-PBX: Extension 215-3700
* AREDN Mesh Network: 2.4 GHz frequency band, channel -2/4, 10 MHz bandwidth, and 5.8 GHz band, channel 179/180, 10 MHz bandwidth
* AMPR 44net
* HamsOverIP: Extension 101249
* Hamshack Hotline: Extension 5501194
