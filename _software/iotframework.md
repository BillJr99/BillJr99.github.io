This software suite contains scripts to collect and store IoT sensor data, such as RFID tag information using an Impinj Speedway RFID reader.  It is modular and generalizable to a variety of sensor systems and processing needs.  

Information about the architecture of this system can be found in my [Ph.D. Dissertation](/publication/dissertation) and on [this paper](/publication/iotdi2017) detailing the use of the framework on RFID-based sensor systems.

The packages for data collection and data processing, respectively, are hosted on GitHub at the following locations:

[IoT Data Processing Framework](https://github.com/drexelwireless/iot-processing-framework) |
